**Slide Deck: Hospital Cybersecurity Breach Training Simulation**

---

**Slide 1: Title Slide**
**Title:** Hospital Cybersecurity Breach Simulation
**Subtitle:** Understanding the Impact of Small Actions on Hospital Security
**Presented by:** \[Your Name], CISO
**Audience:** Nursing Staff, Operational Leaders, Executives

---

**Slide 2: Objectives**

* Demonstrate how one click can compromise the hospital
* Show how attackers escalate privileges and move laterally
* Emphasize importance of patching, policy adherence, and staff vigilance


The demonstration you are about to see is a controlled cybersecurity simulation conducted by trained professionals in a secure, isolated environment. It is part of an Ethical Hacking and Cybersecurity Awareness Exercise designed to educate and empower staff at all levels.

This session is intended for training and awareness purposes only.

Legal Statement:
The tools, techniques, and methods demonstrated today fall under the category of ethical hacking and are used strictly within the boundaries of hospital-approved testing protocols.

Unauthorized use, replication, or distribution of these tools or tactics — inside or outside the hospital — violates hospital policy, federal law, and may result in disciplinary or criminal consequences.

This is not a game. Cybersecurity is a matter of patient safety, data protection, and organizational trust.

Reminder:
"Watching this demonstration does not grant permission to replicate it."



Where do you see the biggest cybersecurity blind spot in your area of responsibility?

Real-World Case Study: CommonSpirit Health Breach (2022–2023)
What Happened:
In October 2022, CommonSpirit Health, the second-largest nonprofit hospital system in the U.S., experienced a ransomware attack that disrupted operations at over 140 hospitals.

Impact:
Electronic health records (EHRs) were offline for weeks
Patient appointments, surgeries, and prescriptions were delayed
Hospitals reverted to paper workflows
Ambulance traffic was diverted in some locations
The breach reportedly cost the organization over $150 million

Root Cause:
Initial access believed to have been gained through a phishing email
Attackers moved laterally and encrypted systems across multiple facilities

**Slide 3: Attack Simulation Flow**
**Visual:** Diagram showing stages:

1. Phishing Email
2. Malicious Installer (AdobeReaderVenom.exe)
3. Meterpreter Session
4. Privilege Escalation
5. Lateral Movement
6. Hospital Disruption

---

**Slide 4: Initial Access**

* Method: Phishing email with a disguised installer
* File: "AdobeReaderVenom.exe"
* Result: Attacker gains remote access to workstation

---

**Slide 5: Privilege Escalation**

* Tool: `post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester`
* Exploit Example: `ms10_015_kitrap0d`
* Goal: Gain SYSTEM-level access

---

**Slide 6: Lateral Movement**

* Scan: Internal network (ARP scan, port scan)
* Target: Unpatched server (e.g., 192.168.1.53)
* Exploit: EternalBlue (MS17-010)
* Result: Additional hosts compromised

---

**Slide 7: Real-World Consequences**

* System shutdowns (e.g., OR closures)
* Delayed patient care
* Legal, financial, and reputational damage

---

**Slide 8: Staff Responsibilities**

* Be cautious with links/attachments
* Install software only via IT-approved methods
* Follow cybersecurity policies
* Report suspicious behavior promptly

---

**Slide 9: Why This Matters**

* Healthcare is a top target for threat actors
* Patient safety, privacy, and trust are at stake
* Strong policies are only effective if followed

---

**Slide 10: Closing Thoughts**
"Every click counts. Every device matters. You are the first line of defense."
